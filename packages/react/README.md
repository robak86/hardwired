### Hardwired React

Integration for [hardwired](github.com/robak86/hardwired) and react. Currently, package provides
support only for functional components.

## Motivation

Despite the fact that React ecosystem promotes rather functional style of programming, dependency
injection which is subjectively more popular in OOP is still relevant for react projects. React in
fact provides mechanism for dependency injection. I'm referring here react context. It
was  introduced a long time before hooks (`useContext`), and it was used by libraries like
react-redux for providing dependencies implicitly through hierarchy of components - in case of
react-redux it was an instance of a redux store. The goal of this library is to provide common
semantics for defining and using

semantics, small framework

## Getting started
